# Features Of Powershell

1. **PowerShell is open-source** - PowerShell base source code is now available in GitHub and open to community contributions. 

2. **Cmdlets** − Cmdlets perform common system administration tasks, for example managing the registry, services, processes, event logs, and using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).

3. **PowerShell design goals** - PowerShell is designed to improve the command-line and scripting environment by eliminating long-standing problems and adding new features.

4. **Task oriented** − PowerShell scripting language is task based and provide supports for existing scripts and command-line tools.

5. **Consistent design** − As cmdlets and system data stores use common syntax and have common naming conventions, data sharing is easy. The output from one cmdlet can be pipelined to another cmdlet without any manipulation.

6. **Simple to Use** − Simplified, command-based navigation lets users navigate the registry and other data stores similar to the file system navigation

7. **Object based** − PowerShell is based on object not text. PowerShell possesses powerful object manipulation capabilities. Objects can be sent to other tools or databases directly.

8. **Extensible interface** − PowerShell is customizable as independent software vendors and enterprise developers can build custom tools and utilities using PowerShell to administer their software.

9. **Easy transition to scripting** - PowerShell's command discoverability makes it easy to transition from typing commands interactively to creating and running scripts.
