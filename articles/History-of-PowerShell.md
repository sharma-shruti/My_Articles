# History of Powershell

*"PowerShell is such a great product because I'm a deeply-flawed human being."*
~ Jeffrey Snover, the inventor of PowerShell.

Before PowerShell, systems and network administrators managing Microsoft software stacks had to resort to using different tools, languages, and technologies to enable automation and integration tasks.

In a lot of ways, administrators had to be creative because there was not one single language and tool they could use to bridge different Microsoft (and non-Microsoft) tasks together. You may know there’s a core architectural difference between Windows and Linux. On Linux, everything’s an ASCII text file, so anything that can manipulate, is a managing tool like awk, grep. However, in Windows, everything is an API that returns structured data.
At that time, Microsoft did not have that powerful a command-line tool.

As a result, <ins>PowerShell</ins> was born.!!!

## Definition:
PowerShell is an object-oriented automation engine and scripting language with an interactive command-line shell that Microsoft developed to help IT professionals configure systems and automate administrative tasks.

## So how it all started ??

Jeffrey Snover initially incubated PowerShell under the project named Monad. He originally described Monad as the next generation platform for automation.

1)	In the year 2002, Monad Manifesto, was published. It contained the concept of this shell and the ideas to create a standardized platform, which used the .NET framework through automation tasks.

2)	In 2003, the first display of Monad was made. The development of the first private prototype was initiated few months after this display, which was accompanied by a public prototype of the shell.
3)	From June 2005 to Jan 2006 3 beta versions of Monad were released by Microsoft. 
4)	On April 25, 2006 Microsoft formally announced that Monad had been renamed Windows PowerShell
5)	This was accompanied by the introduction of Release Candidate 1 of Microsoft PowerShell Programming Language V1.0
6)	The PowerShell version that was compatible with the earlier windows versions was introduced on 30th of January 2007.
7)	The development of PowerShell v2.0 was finalized and release for production in the year 2009. PowerShell v2.0 is integrated with Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7. 
8)	PowerShell version 3.0 is integrated with Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8 and was released in September 2012. This version is an internal part of (WMF3) Windows Management Framework package, which contains the WinRM services to support remoting.
9)	On October 2013 PowerShell version 4.0 was released which integrates with Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows 8.1.
10)	Powershell version 5.0 was released to the web on 24th February 2016, as an internal part of the Windows Management Framework (WMF 5.0). This version is installed by default on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2012.
11)	PowerShell 5.1 was released on 2nd of August 2016, along with the Windows 10 Anniversary update. This version was finally released on 19 January 2017. Microsoft has made it available for Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2. This is the first version that came in two editions of "Core" and "Desktop".
12)	PowerShell Core 6.0 was first announced on 18 August 2016, when Microsoft unveiled PowerShell Core and its decision to make the product cross-platform, independent of Windows, free and open source
13)	PowerShell 7 is the replacement product for PowerShell Core 6.x products as well as Windows PowerShell 5.1, which is the last supported Windows PowerShell version.
