# GNU Core Utils

## GNU project 

**Richard Stallman, the founder of the GNU project, views GNU as a "technical means to a social end".**
*Free Software, Free Society ~*

The GNU Project is a free software, mass collaboration project that Richard Stallman announced on September 27, 1983. Its goal is to give computer users freedom and control in their use of their computers and computing devices by collaboratively developing and publishing software that gives everyone the rights to freely run the software, copy and distribute it, study it, and modify it. GNU software grants these rights in its license.

The goal was to bring a wholly free software operating system into existence. Stallman wanted computer users to be free to study the source code of the software they use, share software with other people, modify the behavior of software, and publish their modified versions of the software. This philosophy was later published as the GNU Manifesto in March 1985

## GNU Core Utils


GNU is an operating system and an extensive collection of computer software. GNU is composed wholly of free software, most of which is licensed under the GNU Project's own General Public License (GPL).
GNU is a recursive acronym for "GNU's Not Unix!" chosen because GNU's design is Unix-like, but differs from Unix by being free software and containing no Unix code.

The GNU Core Utilities are the basic file, shell and text manipulation utilities of the GNU operating system.
These are the core utilities, which are expected to exist on every operating system having 
base commands as follow:

* fileutils: chgrp, chown, chmod, cp, dd, df, dir, du, ln, ls, mkdir, mkfifo, mknod, mv, rm, etc.
* textutils: cat, cksum, head, tail, md, sum, nl, od, pr, tsort, join, wc, tac, paste, etc.
* shellutils: basename, chroot, date, dirname, echo, env, groups, hostname, nice, nohup, printf, sleep, etc.
