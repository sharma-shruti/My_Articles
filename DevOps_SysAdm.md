This is an article on DevOps and SysAdmin :) 

System Administration is the field in IT that allows you to manage, install, configure and maintain the computer systems including hardware, software, and the entire infrastructure to support multi-user environment. SysAdmins job comes with a hugh responsibilty and challenges. System Admins are responsible for monitoring system logs and keeping the systems up and running, providing user access, managing data integrity and security. It's more like a service oriented approach, if there is an incident ticket, SysAdmins try to fix it, document what steps they took, post it to knowledge base and closes the ticket. If anyone runs into that problem again, they should use the documentation to fix it.
